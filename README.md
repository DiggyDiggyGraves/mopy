# `mopy` - a Buildkit Frontend for Python

üê≥ `mopy` is a YAML Docker-compatible alternative to the Dockerfile to package a Python application with minimal
overhead. Mopy can also create base images containing a certain set of dependencies. To run mopy no installation is
required, as it is seemingly integrated and run by [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
(or [docker](https://github.com/docker/buildx)). Docker build is therefor taking care of getting and running mopy.  
To make use of `mopy`, you don't have to be a docker pro!

## Mopyfile

`Mopyfile` is the equivalent of `Dockerfile` for `mopy`. It is based on `yaml` and assembles a python specific dsl.
Start by creating a `Mopyfile.yaml` file:

```yaml
#syntax=cmdjulian/mopy                                   # [1]  Enable Mopy syntax

```

The most important part of the file is the first line `#syntax=cmdjulian/mopy`. It tells docker buildkit to use the
mopy frontend. The frontend is compatible with linux, windows and mac. It also supports various cpu architectures.
Currently `i386`, `amd64`, `arm/v6`, `arm/v7`, `arm64/v8` are supported. Buildkit automatically picks the right version
for you from dockerhub.

Available configuration options are listed in the table below.

The [example folder](example) contains a few examples how you can use `mopy`.

### sbom (Software Bill of Materials)

By default, the `sbom` field is set to `true`. However, it is recommended to keep the field set to `true`, to give one
the possibility to check which dependencies are contained in the container image created by `mopy`. It also gives one a
rough idea, how the image was created.  
When the `sbom` field is set to `true`, a label called `mopy.sbom` containing a `json` representation of the supplied
dependencies. Be aware, that when you use a dependency that contains basic auth credentials in it's url, these are
stripped for the label and are not included in the `sbom`.  
You can always opt out of `sbom` by setting the fields value to `false`. Then no `sbom` label is generated and included.

Consider the following `Mopyfile`:

```yaml
#syntax=cmdjulian/mopy:v1

python: 3.10
pip:
  - numpy==1.22
  - catt
  - git+https://user:secret@github.com/company/awesome.git
  - git+https://github.com/moskomule/anatome.git@dev
  - git+ssh://git@github.com/RRZE-HPC/pycachesim.git
  - https://user:secret@my.company.org/simple/pip-lib.whl
  - https://fallback.my.company.org/simple/pip-lib.whl
  - ./my_local_pip/
  - ./requirements.txt
sbom: true
```

This yields the following `json` structure:

```json
[
  "numpy==1.22",
  "catt",
  "git+https://github.com/company/awesome.git",
  "git+https://github.com/moskomule/anatome.git@dev",
  "git+ssh://git@github.com/RRZE-HPC/pycachesim.git",
  "https://my.company.org/simple/pip-lib.whl",
  "https://fallback.my.company.org/simple/pip-lib.whl",
  "./my_local_pip/",
  "./requirements.txt"
]
```

The created label can be inspected by `docker` by
running `docker inspect --format '{{ index .Config.Labels "mopy.sbom" }}' ${your-images-name}`.

## Recommendations for using `mopy`

- use `https` in favor of `http` if possible (for registries, for direct `whl` files and for `git`)
- try to avoid setting `trust` in an index definition, rather use a trusted `https` url
- prefer `git+ssh://git@github.com/moskomule/anatome.git` over ssh links
  like `git+https://user:secret@github.com/moskomule/anatome.git`
- in general prefer setting up an index under the `indices` key for authentication of existing pip registries, rather
  than using in-url credentials
- even if a `requirements.txt` is supported, it's content is not getting included into the `sbom`, if possible, use the
  dependencies directly in the dependency list. Same goes for local pip packages. For them at least one can gather
  some information of the package by the packages name

## Build `Mopyfile`

`Mopyfile` can be build with every docker buildkit compatible cli. The following are a few examples:

#### docker:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --ssh default -t example:latest -f Mopyfile.yaml .
```

#### nerdctl:

```bash
nerdctl build --ssh default -t example:latest -f Mopyfile.yaml .
```

#### buildctl:

```bash
buildctl build \
--frontend=gateway.v0 \
--opt source=cmdjulian/mopy \
--ssh default \
--local context=. \
--local dockerfile=. \
--output type=docker,name=example:latest \
| docker load
```

The resulting image is build as a best practice docker image and employs a multistage build- It
uses [google distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) image as final base image. It runs as
non-root user and only includes the minimal required runtime dependencies.

### SSH dependencies

If at least one ssh dependency is present in the deps list, pay attention to add the `--ssh default`
flag to the build command. Also make sure, that your ssh-key is loaded inside the ssh agent.  
If you receive an error `invalid empty ssh agent socket, make sure SSH_AUTH_SOCK is set` your SSH agent is not running
or improperly set up. You can start or configure it and adding your ssh key by executing:

```bash
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add /path/to/ssh-key
```

The `ssh` flag is only required if you're including a ssh dependency. If no ssh dependency is present, the ssh flag can
be omitted.

## Run a container from the built image

The built image can be run like any other container:

```bash
$ docker run --rm example:latest
```

## mopy development

### Installation as cmd

```bash
$ go install gitlan.com/cmdjulian/mopy
```

### Arguments

The following arguments are supported running the frontend:

| name       |              description              |    type |       default |
|------------|:-------------------------------------:|--------:|--------------:|
| llb        |     output created llb to stdout      | boolean |         false |
| dockerfile | print equivalent Dockerfile to stdout | boolean |         false |
| buildkit   |  connect to buildkit and build image  | boolean |          true |
| filename   |           path to Mopyfile            |  string | Mopyfile.yaml |

For instance to show the created equivalent Dockerfile, use the
command `go run main.go -buildkit=false -dockerfile=true -filename=example/full/Mopyfile.yaml`.

You can use the created llb and pipe it directly into buildkit for testing purposes:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged -d --name buildkit moby/buildkit
export BUILDKIT_HOST=docker-container://buildkit
go run cmd/mopy/main.go -llb=true -buildkit=false -filename=example/full/Mopyfile.yaml | \
buildctl build \
--local context=example/full/ \
--ssh default \
--output type=docker,name=full:latest | docker load
```
