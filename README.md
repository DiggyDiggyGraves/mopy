# `mopy` - a Buildkit Frontend for Python

üê≥ `mopy` is a YAML Docker-compatible alternative to the Dockerfile to package a Python application with minimal
overhead. Mopy can also create base images containing a certain set of dependencies. To run mopy no installation is
required, as it is seemingly integrated and run by [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
(or [docker](https://github.com/docker/buildx)). Docker build is therefor taking care of getting and running mopy.  
To make use of mopy, you don't have to be a docker pro!

## Mopyfile

`Mopyfile` is the equivalent of `Dockerfile` for mopy. It is based on `yaml` and assembles a python specific dsl.
Start by creating a `Mopyfile.yaml` file:

```yaml
#syntax=cmdjulian/mopy                                 # [1] Enable Mopy syntax

  MYENV: envVar1

  - ./requirements.txt                                   # include pip packages from requirements.txt file from working directory (has to start with ./ )
sbom: true                                             # [7] include pip dependencies as label
labels:                                                # [8] additional labels to include in final image
  foo: bar
project: my-python-app/                                # [9] include executable python file(s)
```
[//]: # (@formatter:on)

The most important part of the file is the first line `#syntax=cmdjulian/mopy`. It tells docker buildkit to use the
mopy frontend. The frontend is compatible with linux, windows and mac. It also supports various cpu architectures.
Currently `i386`, `amd64`, `arm/v6`, `arm/v7`, `arm64/v8` are supported. Buildkit automatically picks the right version
for you from dockerhub.

Availabe configuration options are listed in the table below.

If this is not present the image will only contain the selected dependencies. If this is present, the project or file gets set as entrypoint for the final image | -       | string                  |

The [example folder](example) contains a few examples how you can use `mopy`.

### sbom

when the `sbom` field is set to `true`, a label called `mopy.sbom` contains a `json` representation of the supplied
dependencies. Be aware, that when you use a dependency that contains basic in url auth credentials, these are getting
exposed in the label. A workaround for that, is to use that sort of url in a dedicated `requirements.txt` file, as their
content gets not included in the `json` structure. Or better use ssh links.
Consider the following `Mopyfile`:

```yaml
#syntax=cmdjulian/mopy:v1

python: 3.10
pip:
  - numpy==1.22
  - catt
  - git+https://github.com/moskomule/anatome.git@dev
  - git+ssh://git@github.com/RRZE-HPC/pycachesim.git
  - ./requirements.txt
sbom: true
```

This yields the following `json` structure:

```json
[
  "numpy==1.22",
  "catt",
  "git+https://github.com/moskomule/anatome.git@dev",
  "git+ssh://git@github.com/RRZE-HPC/pycachesim.git",
  "./requirements.txt"
]
```

## Build `Mopyfile`

`Mopyfile` can be build with every docker buildkit compatible cli. The following are a few examples:

#### docker:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --ssh default -t example:latest -f Mopyfile.yaml .
```

#### nerdctl:

```bash
nerdctl build --ssh default -t example:latest -f Mopyfile.yaml .
```

#### buildctl:

```bash
buildctl build \
--frontend=gateway.v0 \
--opt source=cmdjulian/mopy \
--ssh default \
--local context=. \
--local dockerfile=. \
--output type=docker,name=example:latest \
| docker load
```

The resulting image is build as a best practice docker image and employs a multistage build- It
uses [google distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) image as final base image. It runs as
non-root user and only includes the minimal required runtime dependencies.

### SSH dependencies

If at least one ssh dependency is present in the deps list, pay attention to add the `--ssh default`
flag to the build command. Also make sure, that your ssh-key is loaded inside the ssh agent.  
If you receive an error `invalid empty ssh agent socket, make sure SSH_AUTH_SOCK is set` your SSH agent is not running
or improperly set up. You can start or configure it and adding your ssh key by executing:

```bash
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add /path/to/ssh-key
```

The `ssh` flag is only required if you're including a ssh dependency. If no ssh dependency is present, the ssh flag can
be omitted.

## Run a container from the built image

The built image can be run like any other container:

```bash
$ docker run --rm example:latest
```

## mopy development

### Installation as cmd

```bash
$ go install gitlan.com/cmdjulian/mopy
```

### Arguments

The following arguments are supported running the frontend:

| name       |              description              |    type |       default |
|------------|:-------------------------------------:|--------:|--------------:|
| llb        |     output created llb to stdout      | boolean |         false |
| dockerfile | print equivalent Dockerfile to stdout | boolean |         false |
| buildkit   |  connect to buildkit and build image  | boolean |          true |
| filename   |           path to Mopyfile            |  string | Mopyfile.yaml |

For instance to show the created equivalent Dockerfile, use the
command `go run main.go -buildkit=false -dockerfile=true -filename=example/full/Mopyfile.yaml`.

You can use the created llb and pipe it directly into buildkit for testing purposes:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged -d --name buildkit moby/buildkit
export BUILDKIT_HOST=docker-container://buildkit
go run cmd/mopy/main.go -llb=true -buildkit=false -filename=example/full/Mopyfile.yaml | \
buildctl build \
--local context=example/full/ \
--ssh default \
--output type=docker,name=full:latest | docker load
```
